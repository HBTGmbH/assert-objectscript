## Running tests
With an active InterSystems IRIS instance (via docker-compose up -d), execute ``run-tests-in-iris.bat`` or
``run-tests-in-iris.sh``, depending on your OS (windows/linux)

## .vscode/settings.json

This repository is preconfigured to connect your VSCode to the docker based IRIS instance. For more information, visit the awesome [VSCode ObjectScript plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=daimor.vscode-objectscript)) page

## Assert-Objectscript


Assert-Objectscriptm is a supplemental assertion library meant to enhance readability of resulting test failures.

Instead of this
```
AssertEquals:objectA== objectB was '6@%Library.DynamicObject'
```

you will get this
```
AssertFailure:
    Expected:
%DynamicObject(value: Foo)
    to be equal to:
%DynamicObject(value: Bar)
```

## Basic Usage

Assert-Objectscript uses a builder pattern to construct an assertion. It consists of these steps
1. Construct the assertion builder
2. Configure the assertion builder
3. Finish with an assertion

Each assert follows this in the fashion of ``assert...thatActual...is...``

### Construction
Since Assert-Objectscript relies on the basic ObjectScript asserts and the ``AssertFailureViaMacro`` function, a test context with the ``%UnitTest.TestCase`` class must be available. So you will start
any assertion like this.

```scala
set builder = ##class(hbt.utility.testing.AssertBuilder).AssertOnContext($THIS)
```

From there on, you have the choice between an assert on on object or array.

```scala
set arrayAssertBuilder = builder.ThatActualObject(object)
set objectAssertBuilder = builder.ThatActualArray(object)
```

### Configuraion
Once constructed, you can configure your assertion. For example, you could:
1. Use field by field comparison instead of object equality ``UsingFieldByFieldComparison()``
2. Ignore array order ``IgnoringOrder()``
3. Ignore a certain field during field by field comparsion ``IgnoringField("ID")``

### Assertion

Lastly, you need to finish with an assertion.
```scala
builder.ThatActualObject(actual).UsingFieldByFieldComparison().IsEqualTo(Exepcted)
```
